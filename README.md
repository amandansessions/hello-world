# hello-world

Hi everyone!

My name is Amanda.
I have an MS in Computer and Information Sciences.
I dabble in many things, but I find myself drawn to data and visualizations.
I'm working on getting deeper into scripting and automation.
I've done minor development in the past, and I wouldn't mind doing that again to get better.
